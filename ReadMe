## **Sales Analysis Data Project**

This project performs a detailed analysis of sales data, including sales trends, top products, and regional sales performance. The data is cleaned, processed, and analyzed using Python, with visualizations created using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**. Additionally, Power BI is used for interactive visualizations.

### **Project Overview**

The purpose of this project is to analyze sales data to identify:
- **Sales trends** over time.
- **Top-selling products**.
- **Regional sales performance**.

The analysis is implemented in Python and supplemented by interactive visualizations created in Power BI.

### **Project Structure**

The repository is organized as follows:

```bash
├── data
│   └── cleaned_sales_data.csv  # Cleaned sales data
├── visuals
│   └── revenue_trends.png      # Visualization outputs
├── sales_analysis.py           # Main analysis script
├── exploratory_analysis.ipynb  # Jupyter notebook for exploratory data analysis
├── README.md                   # Project documentation
```

---

### **Installation**

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/sales-analysis-project.git
   cd sales-analysis-project
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. Install the required libraries using `pip`:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Example `requirements.txt` file:
   ```text
   pandas
   matplotlib
   seaborn
   jupyter
   ```

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook** (optional):
   If you want to explore the data interactively using Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook exploratory_analysis.ipynb
   ```

---

### **Data**

The data used in this project is stored in the `data/cleaned_sales_data.csv` file. The columns in the dataset include:

- `date`: The date of the sale.
- `product`: Product name.
- `region`: Region where the sale was made.
- `quantity_sold`: Number of units sold.
- `unit_price`: Price per unit.
- `discount`: Discount applied to the sale.
- `revenue`: Total revenue generated from the sale.

---

### **Scripts**

- **`sales_analysis.py`**:
  This script performs the main analysis of sales data. It:
  - Loads the cleaned data.
  - Converts the date column to month.
  - Groups data by month to analyze sales trends.
  - Creates a line plot showing monthly sales trends.

  **To run the script**:
  ```bash
  python sales_analysis.py
  ```

- **`exploratory_analysis.ipynb`**:
  A Jupyter Notebook containing exploratory data analysis and visualizations. You can use this for deeper interactive analysis.

---

### **Visualizations**

The following visualizations are created in the Python script:

- **Sales Trends**: A line chart displaying the total sales revenue over time (monthly or yearly).
- **Top Products**: A bar chart showing the top 5 products based on sales revenue.
- **Regional Sales Performance**: A map or bar chart visualizing sales revenue by region.

---

### **Power BI Dashboard**

In addition to Python visualizations, a Power BI dashboard is created to provide interactive reports, including:
- Sales trends
- Top products
- Regional sales performance

To view the Power BI dashboard:
- Open Power BI Desktop.
- Import the `cleaned_sales_data.csv` file into Power BI.
- Build interactive visualizations following [these steps](#how-to-use).

---

### **How to Use**

1. **Run Analysis**:
   To run the analysis and generate the visualizations, simply run the `sales_analysis.py` script:
   ```bash
   python sales_analysis.py
   ```

2. **Power BI**:
   - Open Power BI Desktop.
   - Load the `cleaned_sales_data.csv` file.
   - Create visualizations for sales trends, top products, and regional sales performance.
